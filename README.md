# Pygame Pacman

A simple game coded with the pygame module.
This python project was created for my bootcamp course with the purpose of testing if I teach myself to adapt to working with code libraries that are new to me.

## How it works.

The game includes:
* One player object. 
* Three enemy objects.
* One prize object.

The enemies move across the screen from different positions, you should dodge them and get to the prize by pressing the up, down, right and left arrows.
